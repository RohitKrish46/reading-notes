# Machine Learning Use Cases

ML exploded in mid-2010s, enabling previously impossible services. Enterprise applications serve both internal (cost reduction, insights, automation) and external (customer experience) use cases.

## Critical Use Cases

**Fraud Detection**
- Oldest ML enterprise application.
- Systems learn from historical fraud patterns to predict future fraudulent transactions.

**Price Optimization** 
- Estimate optimal pricing to maximize margin/revenue/growth
- Best for high-volume, fluctuating demand scenarios (ads, flights, rideshare)

**Customer Acquisition & Retention**
- Average app user acquisition cost(Lyft): $86.61 (2019).
- Even higher for enterprise customers.
- Small reduction in acquisition costs = large profit increase.
- ML enables better targeting, timing, and customer identification.

**Churn Prediction**
- Predict when customers (or employees) will leave.
- Allows proactive retention efforts.
- Critical given high acquisition costs.

**Automated Ticket Classification**
- Reduces response time by routing tickets to correct departments.
- Improves customer satisfaction.
- Works for both customer support and internal IT.

**Brand Monitoring/Sentiment Analysis**
- Track explicit and implicit brand mentions.
- Monitor sentiment trends.
- Early warning system for reputation issues.
